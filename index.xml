      <description>For a long time I have been following the website/project MySensors.org. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about building a temperature and humidity sensor-network in my house for a long time and this project seems to have figured out all the hard stuff (radio communication, low-power battery sensors, network gateway and even controllers).
The Getting Started guide on MySensors.org is a really great starting point to read about the MySensors project and see what it can do.</description>

      <description>Finally I&amp;rsquo;ve made a huge step forward in actually controlling the Itho ventilation box from my arduino, using a CC1150 RF-transmitter. This wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been possible without Sander letting me swap my Itho remote control for his remote control, so thanks Sander!
If you are not interested in how I got this working, but want to see it working for yourself, head straight on over to my GitHub repository and download the code: https://github.</description>

      <description>Two steps forward and one step back (almost like the song). That&amp;rsquo;s what my progress with reverse engineering the Itho RFT remote feels like. I&amp;rsquo;ve made some good progress in sending out the RF signal, but the ventilation box isn&amp;rsquo;t responding. The signal is more complex than I expected.
The first big step forward, since my last blog post was made because I (finally) received the CC1150 board I ordered on eBay.</description>

      <description>Reading back my previous blogpost I noticed that it has been a month since my last post! This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the project has stopped or that I&amp;rsquo;ve lost interest, it just means there is a lot happening in my life and it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to find some spare time to do the work needed to advance this project.
I ended my previous post (part 3) with &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s write some code&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Now that I have saved the data from the logical analyzer, it&amp;rsquo;s time to do the actually analysis. The analyzer software helped me interpret the SPI protocol into hexadecimal values (so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to count each bit individually). But still there is a lot of communication between the ATMEL microprocessor and the CC1150 chip to changes the speed of the Itho ventilationbox.
 The first thing I noticed was that when you press a button once, 3 identical messages are transmitted using the CC1150.</description>

      <description>After a few weeks my eBay-order (with the logical analyzer) arrived and I could finally start with probing the signals between the Atmel and CC1150 on the RFT remote for the Itho ventilation-box. The first challenge I faced was connecting the probes to the right traces on the small RFT board. These traces are so small and the pins of the chips are so tiny that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to attach the probes directly.</description>

      <description>I have recently installed a new centrale-ventilation-box in my home, an Itho CVE ECO RFT. This ventilation box uses a lot less power (&amp;lt;2 watts at low speed) and most importantly makes a lot less noice.    In my first post on this blog Home Automation getting started I said that controlling the ventilation-box from my home-automation system was one of my wishes, so lets get started!
The ventilation-box can be controlled using a RF remote controle with 4 buttons.</description>

      <title>Installing OS on Cubietruck and SSD</title>

      <description>Based on Robert Hekkers experience with installing the Cubieboard3, I downloaded the latest Lubuntu server OS v1.02 image: http://docs.cubieboard.org/tutorials/a20-cubietruck_lubuntu_server_releases
I downloaded and installed the latest Phoenix Suite v1.06 for Windows using this download: http://docs.cubieboard.org/tutorials/common/livesuit_installation_guide After starting the Phoenix Suite, I was asked if I wanted to install the upgrade to v1.08. I clicked “yes”. (btw, DON’T install this software on a VM-ware virtual machine, I couldn’t get a stable connection to the Cubieboard3 and as a result the flashing would not start)</description>

      <description>In the blog of Robert Hekkers he writes he started out using a PC running a single monolithic app developed in Delphi. He recently completed porting all his software from a PC to an ARM-based-board named Cubieboard3 (aka Cubietruck). In my house there is a PC running 24&amp;frasl;7 as a NAS, but I would like to keep things separate so I’m also going to use a Cubieboard.

Robert Hekkers also switched his programming language from Delphi to Node.</description>

      <title>Home automation getting started</title>

      <description>After following the blog of Robert Hekkers for almost a year now, and reading a few other blogs on the subject of home-automation, I’ve decided to start building a home-automation system myself. I’ve come up with a rather long list of things I would like to automate/monitor:
 Monitor temperature in all rooms Monitor humidity in all rooms Monitor windows/doors opening/closing Monitor movement in all rooms Monitor energy/water/gas usages Control radiator valves in all rooms Control central-heating-installation (using OpenTherm) Control motor floor-heating installation Control central-air-refreshment fan Monitor doorbell presses (and make audible throughout the house) Monitor CO2 and CO in all rooms Add webcams Monitor outside temperature/barometric pressure/wind/rain Monitor refrigerator/icebox temperature Monitor dishwasher and washing-machine progress Control lights in and around the house (first are the light in the garden and front-door) Control curtains/rolling window-shutters Control windows opening/closing using motorized arms Control a sliding-door into the backyard to let our cats in and out Control front-door lock using RFID  I know this is an ambitious list, and I know this is going to take quite some time.</description>
